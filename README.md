# React Portfolio

This is my React portfolio, which I designed to be easy to read and navigate. I chose orange and blue as my primary colors because they are complimentary, in addition to being soft on the eyes. The bio page is also the landing page, which features my headshot and two short paragraphs about me. The portfolio page has reusable React card components that function as displays for my projects. I set up the nav bar, header, and footer as React components as well. Deployed application: https://glacial-beyond-18672.herokuapp.com/
